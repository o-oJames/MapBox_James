=================================================
Feature which havn't been implemented:
API endpoint.
tried to realize API endpoint via Flask Rest,
but encountered difficulties when tried to parse input from
HTML to Python. Tried 3 ways: Ajax, PHP, XML. Different errors 
occured. 
Most common error was method not allowed 405 and page not found 404.
